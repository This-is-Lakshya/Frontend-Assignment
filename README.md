## Problem Statement:
You have to create a React application that will allow users to paste a UI schema on the left side and preview the rendered form on the right-hand side. The application will have a single screen which will be divided into two equal sections next to each other. On the left section will be a JSON editor to paste the UI-Schema. On the right section, a form will be automatically rendered based on the pasted UI-Schema.

## Objective:
To develop a web application being able to create "Forms" out of a given JSON UI-Schema.

## Tools & Technologies:
#### React.js, JavaScript(+ES6), CSS, Chakra-UI (React), VSCode, etc.

## Project Description:
There is a "landing page" that shows a option to 'create form'. After clicking on it, you will be directed to a new page, where we've two sections.
"Left Section": You've to paste your JSON UI-Schema here.
"Right Section": Here will be the output form show.

## Features:
- Preview the form (components) in 'Real-Time'.
- Dynamically update the form based on changes in the UI-Schema in the JSON editor component.
- Handle different field types such as text input, radio, switch, group, etc., and render them accordingly with their respective properties.
- It's will show a message (toast) if wrong UI-Schema entered.
- It's will show a message (toast) if there is an empty field, while submitting the form.
- Validation of the UI-Schema to ensure that it follows the required structure and properties.
- Handle form submissions and show the form data to the user which is going to send to the backend using the jsonKey values as keys and the entered values as values.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x.x or higher recommended)
- npm (v6.x.x or higher recommended)

## Installation

    1. Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/This-is-Lakshya/Frontend-Assignment.git

```

    2. Install dependencies 
```bash
  cd Frontend-Assignment
  npm install
```


    3. Start the development server
```bash
  npm start
```

    This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

## Building for production
    To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

    This will build the app for production and output the files to the build folder. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes for efficient caching.
